					<h1>Brief</h1>
				<h4>To make a program for Marsden Gourmet Sandwich Bar to computerise their phone orders. We want this program to enter customer details, able to order sandwich and allow the customer to be able to choose from pick-up or delivery. After this, the program should be able to display the delivery details, the items ordered and the total cost.</h4>

<h3>Sprint Reflection</h3>
<p>This first sprint has a basic 2 option menu that allows the user to print the sandwich menu and to quit.
	When the user chooses to print the menu, it prints the sandwich names and their prices. I have made this program
	to run in a loop, this allows the program to redirect the user to the main menu everytime after they choose to print
	the sandwich menu until they choose to quit. When the quit option is selected, it prints a message that acknowledges
	that the quit has worked and they are no longer using the program. I have included formatting in the printing of the menu,
	this will set up my program nicely for later sprints to be added on easily. I have included basic validation for upper/lower
	case letters, this means if the user enters a lower case letter it'll be read as an upper case letter. By doing this, I reduce
	the chances of my code throwing an error, although I have also added an else function so if an unrecognised entry (not A/a or B/b)
	is entered the program will let the user know that it's not an option. I encountered a few errors when trying to code the
	function for formatting the sandwich menu, so I moved my_list to the main() function which will also help with future proofing.
	I had an error when trying to format my_list when I moved my_list to main(), this did not work out as I got an error when trying
	to print out the list with the formatting.

<h1>Sprint 2</h1>
<h3>Aim: Adding sandwiches to the customer's order and the customer being able to review their order</h3>
<h3>Basic program plan</h3>
				<p>Testing: While trying to test the review function, instead of needing to go through the whole ordering process
				I had already inputted some sandwiches in my_order list so that I could immediately choose the review option to make sure
				this function was being called and working properly. This aided the testing process by using a simple solution to help the
				efficiency of trying to find errors and testing the code.</p>

<h3>Basic Test of Program</h3>
<h3>Sprint Reflection</h3>
<p>This second sprint has 2 more options in the menu that allows the user to order sandwiches and to review their order. When the
user chooses the order option they will be asked how many sandwiches they'd like to order, then they will place their order via inputting the index
number that corresponds with that sandwich. After the customer places their order and the options menu prints again, if they choose the review order option
then the program will print a list of all the sandwiches that the customer has ordered. After the customer has ordered, since the whole option menu
	is on a loop, this means the user can then choose to review their order. The review order function prints out the number of that sandwich the customer has order,
	what sandwich they ordered and the price of the sandwich. It also prints the grand total by adding all the prices of how many and what sandwiches the
	customer ordered. I have added get_string and get_integer functions as well to prevent errors in the future. </p>

<h1>Sprint 3</h1>
<h3>Aim: Adding a edit order option to menu (customer is able to change how many sandwiches they ordered and delete any from their order)
	and also have an option on the menu to have their order delivered (which adds an extra $3 to their total cost) or pick it up which is free of charge.</h3>

<h3>Sprint Reflection</h3>
<p>This third sprint has another 2 options on the menu that lets them edit their order and to choose pick up or delivery for their order. I had a problem with the edit order
function when I first tested and made it. When I first tried to make it so that an item would delete if the customer enter 0, I (.pop)ed the item in the my_order list, so when i tried
to print out a message that notified the customer of what sandwich they just deleted, it wouldn't work because in the .format part of the message telling the code what to input, in the {},
it no longer had that value as that sandwich had already been deleted. So, to solve this I set sandwich_name to the index number and 0 (which is the place in the list the sandwich name was),
so the code still had the information of what sandwich had been deleted. This allowed me to put sandwich_name in the formatting and therefore allowed me to print out a confirmation message for the customer.
Also, for functionality I had to change my first design of printing the confirmation of a delivery and adding $3 to the total. This is because in the transport(O) function I printed a review showing
the $3 added on to the whole order but this is very similar to my review() function. So, I put my delivery fee in my review function so it prints out when the customer chooses the review option. So on the delivery
function it only prints out a message saying that a $3 charge will be added to their order when they choose delivery rather than pick up (which is free so nothing happens). When I tried to do this
I ran into many problems, such as the user not being able to change their mind about getting a delivery as the delivery value would still stay on their bill even though they chose 'P' after they chose 'D'.
So I created a new confirmation function to use for any confirmations in any inputs, I just had to write a message of confirmation and the user can answer 'Y/N'. Before integrating this function, I tested it on my
sandwich_testing file, which is separate from my main code file in order to avoid any drastic errors.</p>

<h1>Sprint 4</h1>
<h3>Aim: Adding more functions to the option menu, the customer can enter their details and can confirm their order</h3>
<h3>Basic program plan</h3>

<h3>Sprint 4 Board in Progress</h3>


<h3>Basic Test of Program</h3>
<h3>Sprint Reflection</h3>
<p>This sprint should be able to collect customer information like their name, their phone number and their address. This sprint should also have an option for the
customer to view descriptions of the sandwiches. I also ran into an error, when I developed my review function I wanted it to also print the customer information. Although, if a customer
	has not yet entered their details then the index number C[0] is out of range because there is not yet anything in the customer_details list. So I had to develop the review function
	even further and I decided to solve it with an 'if' - where it checked if the customer_details list was empty.

				<h1> Relevant Implications Summary</h1>
				<h3>Usability</h3>
				<p>This relevant implication means that a digital product should be able to diagnose and recover from errors
				that are present within the code. I have addressed this relevant implication by using sensible validation methods to reduce
				the number of errors that are able to happen during the program run. An example of this is using the .upper validation so if the
				user enters a lower case letter rather than the capital letter in the options, it will automatically read the lower case letter as
				the upper case letter it's supposed to be.</p>

				<h3>Functionality</h3>
				<p>Another relevant implication addressed in my sandwich program, is functionality. The definition of this implication is creating a digital
				product that is able to work efficiently and has minimal bugs/errors or none at all. The product should be able to do its job flawlessly/ with minimal
				flaws and be able to recognised and identify errors from unexpected inputs. By conducting tests throughout my sprint processes, I have adressed this implication
				accordingly. I have proven this by taking screenshots of my testing and displaying my written plans on paper of sections of my code.
					By doing this, I was able to identify errors during each stage of the coding process so that they didn't develop into big problems and make the whole program crash. </p>
